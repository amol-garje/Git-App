# Git-Project ( Self Learn )
#### *Hello everyone, in this project, I have covered all the concepts related to GitHub and their commands.*

# Introduction :
###
In this project, there are four different developers and one manager. The manager assigns tasks to all six developers, and by using this approach, I try to understand these commands.

Now, let's take a look at some commands:
